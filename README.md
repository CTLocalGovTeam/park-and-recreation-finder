About the Park and Recreation Finder
===================================================
**from [Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/local-government/)**


Park and Recreation Finder is a configuration of ArcGIS for Server and a JavaScript application that allows citizens to locate park and recreation opportunities in their community. This application is typically used by citizens to locate a park in their community that offers a recreation activity they are interested in, but can also be used by visitors to locate a park in a community they are visiting.

How To Use
----------

This application uses the 2.8 version of [Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html); see the site for concepts, samples, and a reference for using the API to create mapping web sites.
