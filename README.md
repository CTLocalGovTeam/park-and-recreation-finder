from Esri's ArcGIS for Local Government team

Park and Recreation Finder is a configuration of ArcGIS for Server and a JavaScript application that allows citizens to locate park and recreation opportunities in their community. This application is typically used by citizens to locate a park in their community that offers a recreation activity they are interested in, but can also be used by visitors to locate a park in a community they are visiting.
